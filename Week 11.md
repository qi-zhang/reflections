<h4>Reflection on "Python for Data Analysis"</h4>

"Python for Data Analysis" is the book recommended in class. As a new learner, I found it is very helpful. The brief introduction to Python's essentials reveals lots of basic ideas. As an object-oriented languange, it is important to understand both what does a data type is trying to modeling as well as related method. The brief review section has plenty of examples to reveal the what does each basic Python data type modeling, and those small samples makes thing easier to understand the purpose and function of each method.

However, data type imported with pandas, numpy ans scipy are more complicated. For example, it is not difficult to imagine what does Data.Frame modeling, but purpose and function of its methods are not. Notice that abbreviated names are widely used and these names could be ambiguous. Furthermore, the examples are so big that it is impossible to review the results of some methods manually. I'm hoping to find some smaller examples in the following chapters.
