<h3>Weekly Reflections for the week 11/17-11/23</h3>

<h4>Importance of Comments</h4>

In order to contribute more to the whole project, now I joined the visualizer's team "visualheart.task8" and we need to enhance code provided by analyzers and make the visualization better, which means I need to review code from other people and revise it. It comes to my attention that sometimes the code is easy to run but not easy to read. In another word, they are not well documented.

The whole idea about this project is a reproducible study which means anyone is allowed to review your code and data and try to reproduce whatever you did. As long as someone might revisit your code later, it is important to keep the code well documented with enough comments to help them understanding the idea. As the matter of fact, the author himself is also benefit from that since in most cases he also needs to revisit the code from time to time for bug-fixing or sort of enhancement. So it is always worthy to have some comments for even a straight-forward trick to the author at that time he developed this code, unless it is common sense for everyone. It is very important part of maintainability of the code.
