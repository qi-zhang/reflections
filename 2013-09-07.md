<h3>Weekly Reflection for the 2nd Week (09/08/13-09/14/13)</h3>

<h4>Summary of vagran Usage</h4>

The most intresting thing this week is to play with vagrant. Vagrant is a pretty cool tool, it allows me to bring up a pre-configured virtual box and get access to it from Git Shell. Here is some commands I found extreamly useful.

To get help for a command: <b>vagrant <command> -help</b>

To remove a virtual box: <b>vagrant box remove <virtualbox name></b>

To install a virtual box: <b>vagrant box add \<vm-name\> \<url\></b> <br>

Before bring up a virtual box for the first time, configure it with command: <b>vagrant init <vm-name></b>

To bring up a vm: <b>vagrant up</b>

Most times, the virtual box will be ready after a while, then I can access the shell with command: <b>vagrant ssh</b>

After log into the system, I can swap files with my host system through <b>/vagrant</b> in the virtual machine, which is mapped to the Git Shell working directory.

If I want to shutdown the virtual box, I can do it with command: <b>vagrant halt</b>

Or do it from the Ubuntu shell with following command: <b>sudo shutdown 0</b>

Vagrant is not perfect, sometimes it lost communication with the virtual box after it bring the virtual box up. I need to wait for a long time before the Git Shell return the control back and there is no way to establish ssh access. In another word, the virtual box is sort of out-of-control. In that case, I need to shut it down with command vagrant halt. Maybe that's why vagrant also provide command:<br><b>vagrant suspend</b><br>With this command allows me to suspend the virtual box instead of shut it down completely. The benefit of doing so is that next time I don't need to worry about the virtual box going out-of-control.
