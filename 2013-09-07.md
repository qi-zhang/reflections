<h3>Weekly Reflections for the week 9/22-9/28</h3>

<h4>Python for Data Analysis</h4>

I'm a new learner to Python, so the first thing I need to do is to find a appropriate book for myself to get start. <br>
There are many python books for new learners in the market, but most of them are for more general purpose. For example the "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz is a popular Python book. It mentioned about different implementations of Python, which is not that relevant to statistic data analysis for a new learner. Python for Data Analysis is a better choice for me. The appendix part reveals something I need to know about Python in only 70 pages, which makes the first step much easier.<br>
Object-oriented is one of important native feature of Python. This feature makes it much easier to do data mining than R.
