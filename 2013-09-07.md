<h3>Weekly Reflection for the 2nd Week (09/08/13-09/14/13)</h3>

<h4>Summary of vagran Usage</h4>

The most intresting thing this week is to play with vagrant. Vagrant is a pretty cool tool, it allows you to bring up a pre-configured virtual box and get access to it from Git Shell. Here is some commands I found extreamly useful.

To get help for a command: <b>vagrant <command> -help</b>

To remove a virtual box: <b>vagrant box remove <virtualbox name></b>

To install a virtual box: <b>vagrant box add <vm-name> <url></b> <br><i>Note the <url> here can be either a URL started with http or local path, if it is URL started with http/ftp, vagrant will download the image from that URL before installation.</i>

Before bring up a virtual box for the first time, configure it with command: </b>vagrant init <vm-name></b>

To bring up a vm: <b>vagrant up</b>

Most times, the virtual box will be ready after a while, then you can access the shell with command: <b>vagrant ssh</b>

<i>Note: You can also make it with any regular ssh client and connect to <b>localhost:2222</b></i>

After log into the system, you can swap files with your host system through <b>/vagrant</b> in the virtual machine, which is mapped to the Git Shell working directory.

If you prefer to shutdown the virtual box, you can do it with command: <b>vagrant halt</b>

Or do it from the Ubuntu shell with following command: <b>sudo shutdown 0</b>

Vagrant is not perfect, sometimes it lost communication with the virtual box after it bring the virtual box up. You need to wait for a long time before the Git Shell return the control back and there is no way to establish ssh access. In another word, the virtual box is sort of out-of-control. In that case, you need to shut it down with command vagrant halt. Maybe that's why vagrant also provide command:<br><b>vagrant suspend</b><br>With this command allows you to suspend the virtual box instead of shut it down completely. The benefit of doing so is that next time you don't need to worry about the virtual box going out-of-control.
