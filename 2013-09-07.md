Reflection for the 1st week (9/1 to 9/7)

It was pretty challenging to get ssh access to the Ubuntu server running on my Virtual box. 

By default there is only one network adaptor, known as “Adaptor 1” and it was attached to “NAT”. Such kind of configuration makes it impossible to access the box with its IP address, not to mention establishing ssh access. 

I tried to re-configure the network adaptor to attach to “bridged adaptor” and I’m able to establish ssh access to it. Soon I found that was not a good idea since the IP address of the box keep changing every time I restarted it.

Finally I configured the “Adaptor 1” back to attached to “NAT” and enabled “Adaptor 2” and let it attached to “Host-Only Adapter”. With help from server guide I found on Ubuntu’s website (https://help.ubuntu.com/13.04/serverguide/network-configuration.html), I finally get the box to support “Adaptor 2” and now I can establish ssh access to the box.

It was pretty challenging for me since this is the first time I learn some terms in networking. But I’m so glad I did it.
