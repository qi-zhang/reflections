<h3>Weekly Reflections for the week 10/27-11/2</h3>

<h4>Data Format</h4>

For this week, we've clarified what each group should do for the final group project. For my part, an analyzer, I should collaborate with team mate to create a model simpler than EATS model but still make the same or better preiction. Since I'll deal with different data formats such as CSV, JSON, XML or KML and I have little background in CS, I spent time on details of these formats. CSV is the most straight-forward format which is pretty much like a dataframe and all information are arranged in a flat manner. JSON is based on hierarchical data structure and the grammar almost identical to that of list and dict object in PYthon. XML  is also based on hierarchical data structure but the grammar is similar to the HTML language. KML is a popular variant of XML and the cool facts is that Google Earth is capable of understanding KML files and bring you to the location of the event descriped by a KML file.
CSV files are pretty easy to read, and JSON files is almost native to Python, KML has derived all benefits of XML and it can be presented in Google Earth in a perfect way. It is possible that we get the data in one format and the following application prefer to get information in another format, as long as there is a clean definition of how those data is organized and accessed, it is possible to convert the original data to any other format.
