<h3>Weekly Reflection for the 3rd Week (09/08/13-09/14/13)</h3>

<h4>Speeches</h4>

Ecologist Eric Berlow’s presentation really fascinated me. First of all, pick an appropriate measurement to measure the effect of different conditions. In Dr. Berlow’s research, to study the effect of commercial horse trip on meadow health, he picked toads present in a certain meadow. Secondly, I learned the importance to look into not only the subjects I’m studying but also the things surrounding them that might have connection with them. This is a process that firstly we separate our interesting subjects and later during the research we need to consider the connection they have with others and the effects of the environment on them. Third, build a good model to perform prediction.

In Professor Stark’s lecture, I began to get a glimpse about building earthquake prediction model. He talked about different possible models for earthquake prediction, such as Possion, Weibull distribution, Brownian, etc. Besides Possion, other distributions are new for me. Hope he’ll talk more about the earthquake model later on.
